# News Summary challenge

I built the SPA App using vanilla JS and my own rudimentary testing Framework 'tea'.

## How to use

`git clone https://github.com/chrisjgilbert/news-summary-challenge`  
`open index.html`   

## Run the tests

`open spec-runner.html` and view the console  

## Desktop NewsFeed view

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.

```
As a busy politician
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are
```

```
As a busy politician
I can click a link to see the original news article
So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story
```

```
As a busy politician
I can see a picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
So that I have something nice to look at
```

```
As a busy politician
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
Just in case my laptop breaks
```
