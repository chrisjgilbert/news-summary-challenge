# News Summary challenge

I built the SPA App using vanilla JS and my own basic testing Framework 'tea'.

## How to use

* `git clone https://github.com/chrisjgilbert/news-summary-challenge`  
* `npm install`
* Add your Guardian API Key to `var guardianUrl = "http://content.guardianapis.com/search?show-fields=body,headline,thumbnail&api-key=" + YOUR_API_KEY`   
* `http-server`   
* `http://localhost:8080/#home`   

## Run the tests

* `open spec-runner.html`
* view the browser console (cmd + option + i for a Mac using Chrome)

## Desktop NewsFeed view
